# Ansible â€” OpenVPN Gateway

The Ansible playbook configures an Ubuntu 20.04 instance running OpenVPN to act as a NAT proxy.

You can run the OpenVPN server for free by using the [Oracle Cloud Always Free](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/#always-free) tier. Terraform script for deploying the server is below,
* terraform__oci-instance-1
    * GitHub: [github.com/k3karthic/terraform__oci-instance-1](https://github.com/k3karthic/terraform__oci-instance-1)
    * Codeberg: [codeberg.org/k3karthic/terraform__oci-instance-1](https://codeberg.org/k3karthic/terraform__oci-instance-1)

The following Ansible playbook covers basic setup for Ubuntu (e.g, swap, fail2ban),
* ansible__ubuntu-basic
    * GitHub: [github.com/k3karthic/ansible__ubuntu-basic](https://github.com/k3karthic/ansible__ubuntu-basic)
    * Codeberg: [codeberg.org/k3karthic/ansible__ubuntu-basic](https://codeberg.org/k3karthic/ansible__ubuntu-basic)

You can get a free hostname for the OpenVPN server using the Ansible playbook below,
* ansible__oci-ydns
    * GitHub: [github.com/k3karthic/ansible__oci-ydns](https://github.com/k3karthic/ansible__oci-ydns)
    * Codeberg: [codeberg.org/k3karthic/ansible__oci-ydns](https://codeberg.org/k3karthic/ansible__oci-ydns)

## Requirements

Install the following before running the playbook,
```
pip install oci
ansible-galaxy collection install oracle.oci
```

## Dynamic Inventory

The Oracle [Ansible Inventory Plugin](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/ansibleinventoryintro.htm) populates public Ubuntu instances.

The target Ubuntu instances must have the freeform tag `openvpn_service: yes`.

## Playbook Configuration

1. Update `inventory/oracle.oci.yml`,
    1. Specify the region where you have deployed your server on Oracle Cloud
    1. Configure the authentication as per the [Oracle Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm#SDK_and_CLI_Configuration_File)
1. Set username and ssh authentication in `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`
1. Set the OpenVPN virtual network in `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`

## Deployment

Run the playbook using the following command,
```
./bin/apply.sh
```

## Certificate Authority Setup

We need to create a Certificate Authority (CA) for the OpenVPN server and clients. A key signing server generates and signs certificates used for authentication.

For security, the key signing server should be a standalone server. The OpenVPN server can act as the key signing server for smaller deployments. 

To get started, install [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) on the system you will be using as the key signing server.

### Initialize easy-rsa

Run the following commands on the key signing server.

Create a new Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and CA,
```
$ ./easyrsa init-pki
$ ./easyrsa build-ca
```

### Create files for OpenVPN server

Run the following commands on the key signing server.

Create and sign a certificate for the OpenVPN server,
```
$ ./easyrsa gen-req Relay
$ ./easyrsa sign-req server Relay
```

Generate the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters for the OpenVPN server,
```
$ ./easyrsa gen-dh
```

Copy `pki/ca.crt` and `pki/dh.pem` into the `ca` folder of the current repository. Create a file called `ca/Relay.pass` with the passphrase of the Relay private key (Relay.key).

Install OpenVPN on the key signing server and run the following command. This is only required to generate a shared secret for TLS authentication.
```
$ openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key
```

Copy `ta.key` into the `ca` folder of the current directory.

### Create files for Client

Run the following commands on the key signing server.

Create and sign a certificate for the Client App,
```
$ ./easyrsa gen-req Client1
$ ./easyrsa sign-req client Client1
```

Copy `pki/ca.crt`, `pki/ta.key`, `pki/private/Client1.key`, `pki/issues/Client1.crt` to the client. Enter the passphrase of the private key during import or in the configuration.

## Encryption

Encrypt sensitive files (SSH private keys) before saving them. `.gitignore` must contain the unencrypted file paths.

Use the following command to decrypt the files after cloning the repository,

```
$ ./bin/decrypt.sh
```

Use the following command after running terraform to update the encrypted files,

```
$ ./bin/encrypt.sh <gpg key id>
```
